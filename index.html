						# What is Git?



						## According to git-scm.com:

						> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

						
						## But what does that mean and what problem does Git solve?


						### Have you ever worked on project that starts out like this?

						```bash
						project
						└── my_project_2018-09-25.txt
						```

						Note: Have you ever worked on a paper or a project where maybe after you finished your first draft and got some feedback and before you start working on the next draft you name the file something like `my_project_2018-09-25.txt`
						Then you start on the next draft and you repeat the process and name it like `my_project_2018-10-18.txt`
						And so on and so forth and eventually you end up with a directory that looks like this:


						### And after a few interations your project looks like this?

						```bash
						project
						├── my_project_2018-09-25.txt
						├── my_project_2018-10-18.txt
						├── my_project_final.txt
						├── my_project_final_final.txt
						└── my_project_final_final_THIS_ONE.txt
						```

						Note: Now imagine you and a team were working on this project and you were saving files like this and each person was making their own changes and sharing the files back and forth.


						## Git provides a way to track incremental changes and share those changes with others

						And, when using Git jhcorrectly it gives you the confidence to break stuff

						Note: 
							In our example what would happen if two people made changes to the same file at the same time?  
							They would have to manually figure out what to keep and what to get rid of. Git can do this automatically and when it can't it provides a convient interface for doing it yourself.

						# What is GitHub?
						and how is it different from Git?


						## According to GitHub's website:

						> GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 31 million developers.


						# What does that even mean?


						Basically GitHub is a cloud based Git server. It provides a place for developers to `push` and store their Git projects and it makes it easier for multiple people to work on the same project.


						## Confused?
						Let's get started!

						Note: This is all still a little confusing and highlevel so lets get started on a project and hopefully that will clarify things.

						## Step 0 - Fork the Repo

						- Go to this url: https://github.com/codeforgso/github-workshop-site
						- Click the `Fork` button in the upper right corner <!-- TODO: Screenshot? -->


						### "What did I just do?"

						#### You forked a repo!  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


						Forking is Git terminology for copying someone else's project.  
						It provides a place for you to make your own changes and if you want you can later give your changes back to the original repo.  

						When contributing to projects in a team (and especially in open source) this is the first step
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-separator-vertical="^\n\n">
					<textarea data-template >
						## Step 1 - Clone your newly forked repo

						Mac/Linux - Open terminal  
						Windows - Open Git Bash Type the following

						```bash
						git clone git@github.com:/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/github-workshop-site/
						# You can copy the URL from GitHub page
						cd github-workshop-site # Change directory to project
						ls -a # List all files in the directory
						```

						Note: Throughout this entire tutorial we will be using the Terminal on Mac/Linux or Git Bash on Windows


						### "What did I just do?"

						#### You cloned a repo!  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


						Cloning is when you download a copy of a Git project to your computer
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-separator-vertical="^\n\n">
					<textarea data-template >
						# "Wait! this is confusing! How is cloning different from forking?!"


						Cloning is different because you are downloading the project to your machine. With forking you are creating your own copy of the project remotely.


						If there is ever a project you just want to use and not contribute to, you'd often skip forking it and would just clone it.

					</textarea>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-vertical="^\n\n">
					<textarea data-template >
						## Step 3 - Branches


						## So I downloaded the project. Now what?

						Note:
							Alright, so you have the project on your machine and it's time for you to make some changes to it
						Note: 
							Let's assume your team wants you to _change something on the website_. Using Git, how do we go about this?  
						Note: there are many ways to do this with Git, but we are making the assumption that your are working on a team. And for that assumption, this is a common workflow you would see.


						Let's make a change!

						```bash
						git checkout -b my-contribution
						git branch # Shows you a list of all your local branches. Press `q` to exit
						```
